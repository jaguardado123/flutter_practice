# Flutter Practice

This is not a homework nor exercise assignment. The purpose of this repo is so that you can follow along with in-class examples without having to install Flutter in your personal computer.

## Getting Started

You need to follow the steps below to be able to run your Flutter application.

### Install Extensions and Dependencies

First, install the `Dart` and `Flutter` extensions in Visual Studio Code.

Next, install the necessary Flutter dependencies by running the command below in your terminal.

```
flutter pub get
```

### Run the App

To run your Flutter applications, you need to run the `run.sh` bash script. Use the command below in your terminal.

```
./run.sh
```

### View the App in Browser

Open the **Ports** tab in your bottom screen (where your terminal is). Change the visibility of port `3000` to **public**, then right-click on the URL and select **Open in Browser**.
